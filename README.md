## Introduction:

Humans are not on the menu of sharks. Sharks bite humans out of curiosity or to defend themselves. With a better understanding of the significance of shark/human interactions we can **minimize the risk of being injured by a shark** and concentrate on the conservation of all shark species worldwide. In this way a education campaign can be done to teach people how to co-exist with sharks.

## Spoiler!

If you don't want to get bit by a shark avoid wandering in **New Smyrna Beach (Florida)** between 12 and 5 in the Summer. [Bryan](https://www.surfline.com/surf-news/hurricane-matthew-passes-sharks-show-up-at-the-inlet-shark-attacks-surfer-in-new-smyrna-beach_142356/) was hit on the knee while surfing in  this beach and, while there was a reasonable amount of blood, turns out he's fine!
